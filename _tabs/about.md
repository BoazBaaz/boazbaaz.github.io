## About Me

I'm Boas-Bas van der Veen, a third-year student at Breda University of Applied Sciences pursuing Creative Media and Game Technologies with a specialization in engine and tools programming.

## Technical Focus

My work centers on low-level engine development and tools creation. I've built custom game engines from scratch, developed Unreal Engine plugins and editor tools, and created numerous Unity projects throughout my academic career. My technical expertise spans C++ engine architecture, graphics programming with OpenGL and Vulkan, and cross-platform build systems using CMake.

## Professional Experience

At Koninklijke Landmacht (Royal Netherlands Army), I contributed to Virtual Battle Space (VBS) training scenarios, applying game programming skills to develop realistic military simulations. This experience taught me the importance of precision, collaboration, and delivering robust technical solutions under real-world constraints.

## Current Work

I'm currently developing:
- Unreal Engine editor extensions and gameplay tools
- Grid-based systems with advanced tile evaluation
- Cross-platform C++ game engine architecture
- Custom shader systems and visual scripting solutions
